## Skin-Cancer-Detection
We know healthcare professionals face countless decisions daily, so we've created a simple but powerful tool to support your clinical judgment. Think of it as having a helpful second opinion right at your fingertips.
Here's what makes DermHelper special:
‚ú® Lightning fast: Get insights in under 3 seconds
üîí Completely private: Your images stay on your device - no uploading required
üè• Made for medical professionals: Helps prioritize high-risk cases
ü§ù Always available: Free access whenever you need it
How it works is simple: Take a photo of the skin lesion, and DermHelper will suggest the three most likely matches from seven common types. It's like having a knowledgeable colleague take a quick look, but available 24/7.
The science behind it? We've trained our AI using the respected HAM10000 dataset - a vast collection of verified skin lesion images that dermatologists trust. But remember, DermHelper is here to assist, not replace, your expertise. Think of it as a helpful tool in your diagnostic toolkit.
We built this because we believe modern technology should make healthcare professionals' lives easier, while keeping patient care and privacy at the heart of everything.
Would you like to know more about how it could fit into your workflow, or shall we dive right in and give it a try?
(Note: We went with a friendly but professional tone here, avoiding heavy medical jargon while maintaining credibility. I can adjust the tone further if you'd like it more casual or more formal.)

What Is Skin Cancer?

Skin cancer is the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the epidermis, the outermost skin layer, caused by unrepaired DNA damage that triggers mutations. These mutations lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors. The main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

Read on to find out what can cause skin cancer.

What Does Skin Cancer Look Like?

Skin cancers can look quite different from one person to another due to skin tone, size and type of skin cancer and location on the body. See our Skin Cancer Pictures page for a selection of photos to help you understand what skin cancers can look like. View pictures.

What Causes Cancers of the Skin?

The two main causes of skin cancer are the sun‚Äôs harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and using UV tanning beds. The good news is that if skin cancer is caught early, your dermatologist can treat it with little or no scarring and high odds of eliminating it entirely. Often, the doctor may even detect the growth at a precancerous stage, before it has become a full-blown skin cancer or penetrated below the surface of the skin.

Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id-column within the HAM10000_metadata file.

The test set is not public, but the evaluation server remains running (see the challenge website). Any publications written using the HAM10000 data should be evaluated on the official test set hosted there, so that methods can be fairly compared.
